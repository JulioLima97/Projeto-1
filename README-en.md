# Project-1

## Project Description
In this project, I developed a comparison of the musical preferences of the inhabitants of Springfield and Shelbyville. I examined real data from Y.Music to test the hypothesis below and compare user behaviors in these two cities.


## Hypotheses
User activity is different depending on the day of the week and the city.
During Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This is also true for Friday nights.
Springfield and Shelbyville listeners have different preferences. In Springfield, people prefer pop, while Shelbyville has more rap fans.


## Description of columns:
• `userID` — user identifier  
• `Track` — track title  
• `artist` — artist name  
• `genre` — music genre  
• `City` — user’s city  
• `time` — the exact time the track was played  
• `Day` — day of the week

Note: This project was developed based on the guidance I received to improve my logical reasoning as a student. As a result, I kept all requested orders related to guidance on carrying out the necessary calculations.
